# Roadmap

## Goal

Maintain a single-file seed that can be copied into any project to establish
consistent agent behavior, artifact formats, and safety guardrails.

## Current Focus

v1 is complete. Ready for real-world testing across projects.

## Completed

- AGENT_BLUEPRINT v1: safety rules, adoption workflow, guardrails
- AGENTS.md template with command categories and project-specific rules
- Roadmap template and structure
- Decision artifact format (markdown and matrix-reloaded JSON)
- Session log format
- Regulated environments guidance

## Backlog

- Test adoption in 2-3 existing projects and gather friction points
- Consider whether DESIGN_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md should be folded in or kept separate

## Rules

- This file is the canonical roadmap.
- Keep it short; archive when it grows stale.
