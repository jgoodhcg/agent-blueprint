# Roadmap

## Canonical State

**Goal:** Maintain a reusable, versioned AGENTS core policy that can be copied into projects as the source of truth.

**Current Focus:** Draft and stabilize AGENTS_CORE v1 (baseline rules, adoption workflow, decision matrix guidance).

**Active Work Units:**
- AGENTS_CORE v1 baseline (structure, workflow, validation, safety)
- Adoption workflow (new projects, missing AGENTS.md, legacy instructions)

**Backlog / Ideas:**
- agents-core-sync skill (init/sync/refresh across repos)
- Decide and document log format (session/decision/change/task)

## Roadmap Rules
- This file is the canonical roadmap (no separate index).
- One work unit at a time for LLM sessions.
- Keep updates short and narrative; avoid checklists unless needed.

## Maintenance
- Periodically prune and update the roadmap with current state.
- Archive entire file when appropriate (create dated version before major rework).
